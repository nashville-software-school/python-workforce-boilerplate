# Bangazon Workforce Management Site

Your team is reponsible for building an internal application for our human resources and IT departments. The application will allow them to create, list, and view Employees, Training Programs, Departments, and Computers.

You will be building an Django-based web application for this sprint with SQLite as the database engine. You will be learning the Django templating syntax. You will be learning how to define the data structures that will be bound to your templates. You will also be learning the concept of integration testing. Your tests will perform GET and POST requests to your application and verify that each view works as expected.
